## Explanation
### I have not included my favorite program from university - the one when completed brought outstanding pride and joy - an elementary Turing machine.  It was written in C++ and was no more than 40 lines (including the project comments!), so to fully get the effect I would need to include the previous 6 projects that delved into state machines and all the fine things one learns in Discrete Structures.   What I have included are examples of languages and language paradigms that have formed my outlook and understanding on programming.

## Examples

### R
#### R is a language and environment built on the prexisting S language (created at Bell Labs in 1976) for statistical computing and graphics.  It's notable to me because it is the first language (outside of Object_Oriented staples, C++ and Python), that I delved deep into its semantic and syntax.  I wrote a paper about its origins, purpose, and efficacy.  Click [here](github.com/sdmace1110/portfolio/papers_research) to learn more.

### Programming Paradigms
#### There are four main programming paradigms and they each introduce their own plusses and minuses as a language.  They are Object-Oriented, Functional, Logical, and Imperative.  Imperative languages closely resembles machine language and operates each assigned ordered steps. The other three paradigms are demonstrated, one, with a Racket IDE and the other using Prolog. 

### Functional Programming
#### Racket is a language based on the Scheme dialect of LISP used for scripting, computer science education, and research.   Scheme was the first dialect of Lisp, the second-oldest high-level programming language (1958) whose many operation mode was through manipulation of list, to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations. It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp.

### Logical Programming
#### Prolog is a logic programming language associated with AI and computational linguistics.  It has its roots in first-order logic, formal logic, but unlike most other programming languages, Prolog was strictly intended as a declarative programming language.  It uses relations as rules and facts through computational queries of these relationships.

### Object Oriented Programming
#### OO programming is ubituitous.  Many of the most popular languages use OO principles.  I went outside of the box for this example.  It is a stack application using COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Language) which was devised as a small yet complete OO language to teach compiler design.    

### C++
#### MazeSolution is a C++ program that uses recursive function calls to solve a given maze.  It is modularized and a makefile has been included.

### ASM
#### Lab1 is a program written in x86 which accepts two integers and returns the sum of the two variables.
