# Educational Examples: 

## Overview
### Inside this folder I have uploaded projects from university courses that stuck with me.  This is in an effort to demonstrate a breadth of thought that I have given to writing code or developing software.  These may seem disparate or disjointed languages or projects, but they all coalesce to form my skills and thoughts on programming.

### I have not included my favorite program - the one when completed brought outstanding pride and joy - an elementary Turing machine.  It was written in C++ and was no more than 40 lines (including the project comments!), so to fully get the effect I would need to include the previous 6 projects that delved into state machines and all the fine things one learns in Discrete Structures.   What I have included are examples of languages and language paradigms that have formed my outlook and understanding on programming.

## Examples

### R

#### R is a language and environment built on S through GNU for statistical computing and graphics.

### Racket
#### Racket is a language based on the Scheme dialect of Lisp.  It is used for scripting, computer science education and research.   Scheme was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations. It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp.

### Prolog
#### Prolog is a logic programming language associated with AI and computational linguistics.  It has its roots in first-order logic, formal logic, but unlike most other programming languages, Prolog was strictly intended as a declarative programming language.  It uses relations as rules and facts through computational queries of these relationships.

#### R is a language and environment built on S through GNU for statistical computing and graphics.  It's notable to me because it is the first language (outside of Object_Oriented staples, C++ and Python), that I delved deep into its semantic and syntax.  I wrote a paper about its origins, purpose, and efficacy.  Click [here](github.com/sdmace1110/portfolio/papers_research) to learn more.

### Racket
#### Racket is a language based on the Scheme dialect of Lisp used for scripting, computer science education, and research.   Scheme was the first dialect of Lisp, the second-oldest high-level programming language (1958) whose many operation mode was through manipulation of list, to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for **functional programming** and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations. It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp.

### Prolog
#### Prolog is a **logic programming** language associated with AI and computational linguistics.  It has its roots in first-order logic, formal logic, but unlike most other programming languages, Prolog was strictly intended as a declarative programming language.  It uses relations as rules and facts through computational queries of these relationships.

### C++
#### MazeSolution is a C++ program that uses recursive function calls to solve a given maze.  It is modularized and a makefile has been included.

### ASM
#### Lab1 is a program written in x86 which accepts two integers and returns the sum of the two variables.
